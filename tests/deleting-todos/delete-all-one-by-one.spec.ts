        // Test implementation for: Delete All Todos One by One
    // Steps from plan:
    // **Steps:**
    // 1. Navigate to the application root URL (`/`)
    // 2. Add three todos: "First", "Second", "Third"
    // 3. Delete "First" by clicking its × button
    // 4. Delete "Second" by clicking its × button
    // 5. Delete "Third" by clicking its × button
    // 
    // **Expected Results:**
    // - After each deletion, the remaining todos are displayed
    // - After final deletion, todo list is empty
    // - Main section and footer disappear
    // - Only header remains visible
    // 
    // **Seed:** `tests/seed.spec.ts`

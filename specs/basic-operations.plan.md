# TodoMVC Application - Basic Operations Test Plan

## Application Overview

The TodoMVC application is a React-based todo list manager built with TypeScript and Vite. It provides comprehensive task management functionality with the following key features:

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete individual todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all todos as complete/incomplete and clear all completed todos
- **Filtering**: View todos by All, Active, or Completed status with URL routing
- **URL Routing**: Direct navigation to filtered views (`/`, `/active`, `/completed`)
- **Counter Display**: Real-time count of active (incomplete) todos with proper pluralization
- **Input Validation**: Prevents empty or whitespace-only todos from being added
- **Persistence**: Automatic localStorage integration to persist todos across sessions
- **Edit Mode**: Double-click to edit todo text inline with Enter to save and Escape to cancel
- **Responsive Design**: Classic TodoMVC styling with hover effects and visual feedback

## Test Execution Notes

### Prerequisites
- Application must be built: `npm run build`
- Test server must be running: `npm run preview`
- Browser automation tools must be configured

### Test Data Assumptions
- All tests assume starting with a clean slate (no existing todos in localStorage)
- Each test should clear localStorage before execution or use isolated browser contexts
- Tests should be independent and runnable in any order

### Browser Compatibility
- Tests should run in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Focus on Chromium-based testing as primary target

### Accessibility Considerations
- Verify keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Ensure screen reader compatibility for interactive elements
- Test focus management during edit mode

### Performance Considerations
- Test with large numbers of todos (100+) to verify performance
- Verify localStorage limits are not exceeded
- Check for memory leaks with repeated add/delete operations

## Success Criteria

A test scenario passes when:
- All steps execute without errors
- Expected results match actual outcomes
- No visual or functional regressions occur
- Application state remains consistent
- No console errors are generated

A test scenario fails when:
- Any expected result does not match actual behavior
- Application crashes or becomes unresponsive
- Data loss or corruption occurs
- Unexpected errors appear in console
- UI breaks or becomes unusable

## Coverage Summary

This test plan provides comprehensive coverage of:
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** (empty, whitespace, special characters)
- ‚úÖ **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ‚úÖ **State management** (completion toggling, bulk operations)
- ‚úÖ **Filtering and routing** (URL-based navigation)
- ‚úÖ **Persistence** (localStorage integration)
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX** (visibility, hover states, layout)
- ‚úÖ **Edge cases** (long text, duplicates, rapid operations)
- ‚úÖ **Counter accuracy** (singular/plural, updates)
- ‚úÖ **Edit mode** (save, cancel, delete behaviors)

**Total Test Scenarios: 61 individual test cases organized into 11 functional categories**
